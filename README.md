# VNocr
OCR script for Visual Novels/general text on images

1. `xfce4-screenshooter`
screenshots a region and saves it to ~/ocr.png
swap it to your own screenshot program if it doesn't work
1. `tesseract`
processes that image and outputs the text it finds to ~/ocr.txt
install tesseract, I used `sudo apt install tesseract-ocr` on xubuntu
https://github.com/tesseract-ocr/tesseract
and download and put trained models for the language you need where they belong, it was `/usr/share/tesseract-ocr/4.00/tessdata` for me
https://github.com/tesseract-ocr/tessdata_best
1. `tr`
cleans up output text from tesseract
1. `xclip`
passes text in clipboard with where it is caught by yomichan
that opens a popup with that text where you can look up word definitions
make sure to check "Enable native popups when copying Japanese text" in yomichan options
(be careful when copying big texts that can contain kana/kanji in them)
